WeakAura-World-of-Warcraft-WrongEquipmentSet

A custom lua file for the addon WeakAuras2 of the game World of Warcraft
It returns text whenever the current equipment set's name does not include the name of the current spec
As such, in order to use this file, name your equipment sets something like: "Feral", "FeralAoE", "FeralSingleTarget", etc.

The resulting WeakAura is used for ensuring that you're always in one of the correct equipment sets for your spec, and don't forget to swap, like an idiot (I can neither confirm nor deny that I have forgotten that once or twice).
